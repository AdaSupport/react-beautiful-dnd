This is a fork of [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/blob/master/.size-snapshot.json) that supports dragging children from/into parent lists. This allows it to be used for dragging in trees instead of just lists and boards. To use it in your own packages:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-beautiful-dnd": "ianstormtaylor/react-beautiful-dnd#release"
  }
}
```
